TimeHunt
========

How many times have you sat in a dear blind wondering how soon until you can take your first shot? With that 10 point buck strutting in front of you every second counts. At the same time, no hunter wants to risk shooting too early or too late. With TimeHunt you'll never have to parse complicated DNR timesheets or just plain not know again.

Times are displayed for each day of the hunting season for when hunting starts and ends and also sunrise and sunset. The ability to add notifications (silent, of course) is also available for the start, 15 minutes before, and 1 hour before each hunting time event.

Having TimeHunt on your phone will have you never guessing again about hunting times!
